fixing the formatting of locations to be more readable after a json.dump

>>> x = open("locations_new.json").read()
KeyboardInterrupt
>>> xx = x.replace(",\n                                ",", ")
KeyboardInterrupt
>>> xxx = xx.replace("\n                            }"," }")
KeyboardInterrupt
>>> xxxx = xxx.replace("{\n                                ","{ ")



for enemies

>>> x = open("enemies.json").read()
>>> xx = x.replace(",\n                ", ", ")
>>> xxx = xx.replace("\n            ]", " ]")
>>> xxxx = xxx.replace("[\n                ", "[ ")



add isboss to location entities
add a bunch of different stuff to the enemies, make each variation a dict with "vars" and the ability for other params like nightmare
   when the dict is gotten, merge the parent and the kid (so if nightmare in parent)
msn needs to be listed in the enemies
hp and level and spawnlimiter needs to be tracked in the enemies.json
