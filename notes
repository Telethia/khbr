fixing the formatting of locations to be more readable after a json.dump

>>> x = open("locations_new.json").read()
KeyboardInterrupt
>>> xx = x.replace(",\n                                ",", ")
KeyboardInterrupt
>>> xxx = xx.replace("\n                            }"," }")
KeyboardInterrupt
>>> xxxx = xxx.replace("{\n                                ","{ ")



for enemies

>>> x = open("enemies.json").read()
>>> xx = x.replace(",\n                ", ", ")
>>> xxx = xx.replace("\n            ]", " ]")
>>> xxxx = xxx.replace("[\n                ", "[ ")



add isboss to location entities
add a bunch of different stuff to the enemies, make each variation a dict with "vars" and the ability for other params like nightmare
   when the dict is gotten, merge the parent and the kid (so if nightmare in parent)
msn needs to be listed in the enemies
hp and level and spawnlimiter needs to be tracked in the enemies.json

need a solution for msns for the AS's since they only have one MSN.... Can probably be something hacky
the cups guys also have MSN's that shouldn't change, think about how to add this
and like blizzard lord/volcano lord.... maybe just make these msns not replaced and limit who can be put there

need to implement replaceallowed=false

for the ones that don't get the msn replaced, you will likely want to craft a new MSN for them that works
