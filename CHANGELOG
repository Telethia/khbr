3.0.0
* Fix crash that was preventing FF bosses from being randomized on PC (the mission complete camera will look different from normal)
* Updated allowed replacements for reducing known softlocks/crashes
* Prevent bosses from spawning in Encampment, when bosses as enemies mode is enabled
* Added an AllocEnemy line to event scripts on PC, which should help prevent crashes due to going out of memory on PC (IE limit form against Lexaeus was a common one)
* Refactoring of some internals to allow for additional features
* Final Xemnas now works regardless of if Lua support is being used
* Struggle bosses have all been reenabled on PC
* Struggle fights will now prevent the placed boss from dying, so the struggle fight is actually a full struggle
* The Illuminator will no longer move from the spot where Barbossa spawns it, to prevent issues where it moves to a unreachable location
* Now generating a custom moveset (thanks to DA) for Sora that will allow Twilight Thorn to work without major AI modifications
* Jafar has been added into the randomization pool for Wild boss replacement mode
* Demyx OC has been added into the randomization pool
* Randomize superbosses option has been split into 3 options, for terra, sephiroth, and the datas
* Cutscene Remover option has been added, with 3 different options (PUT MORE DESCRIPTION HERE)
* Enabled randomizing the two single dusk fights in STT where the enemy is invulnerable

2.3.0
* Added an option to enable randomizing Final Xemnas (and data), which requires the newest version of Model Manager to be used (which supports LUA scripts)
* Added an option to treat Nobodys as a separate type of enemy, depending on the other options enabled this can cause some enemies to randomize very predictably
* Updated several bosses allowed replacements to reduce the possibility of known softlocks/crashes (common ones involving Barbossa, Grim Reaper 2, Demyx)
* Remove Scar Ghost from being able to appear as a boss enemy
* Fixed MSN files getting created without the .bar extension
* Fixed cases where some bosses were not getting properly changed when a specific boss was selected
* Prevent any attempt at randomizing Battle of 1K, to prevent crashes
* Prevent bosses from spawning in The Ravine or Checkpoint rooms, when bosses as enemies mode is enabled.
* Fixed Issue where Grim Reaper II in it's vanilla location in Wild mode could result in a softlock
* Due to an RC Related softlock, Axel Data will never replace Xaldin, it will always be Axel II
* Due to a crash during DM, if Luxord Data is supposed to replace Luxord, the fight will stay vanilla Luxord
* Fixed issue where Hydra's MSN was not being properly replaced, causing bosses like Luxord or Demyx to softlock
* Moved Spawn locations in Armor Xemnas 1 fight to prevent bosses getting softlocked by landing strangely on the throne
* Move Spawn location for Groundshaker in front of Sora and to ground level
* Fully disable Xemnas I's DM, so Sora's HP is no longer locked into always draining during the fight
* Prevent the option for Mickey appearing in STT boss fights, due to Roxas missing animations for summoning mickey causing T-Poses

2.1
* Redesigned "Wild" enemies to now only put up to 5 different kinds of enemies in any one room (between all spawns in that room), which should make it mostly playable. This number will be reduced if necessary, and Wild is still only possible for PC. Due to the way the randomization is currently implemented, some enemies will be very likely to be vanilla (for example, the Bolt Towers in the first part of the Minnie Escort fight)
* Increased the number of bosses available when Bosses are allowed to replace normal enemies, and increased the odds of a boss replacement occuring to about 1 in 80 enemies
* If Data Demyx is to be placed in either Groundshaker or Scar's location, he will be forced to normal Demyx.
* Disable the "nobady_call" attack for Armor Xemnas 1, which should prevent crashing on PC

2.0
* Full redesign of the backend, to make future updates easier
* PC is now be able to load cups when enemies are randomized
* Options to not randomize big and small enemies separately. Warning should only be used on PC and it is experimental and may cause crashes
* Options to not randomize melee and ranged enemies separately. Warning should only be used on PC and it is experimental and may cause crashes
* Option to randomize enemies independently of each other. Warning should only be used on PC and it is experimental and will probably cause crashes
* Beast is added into the randomization pool, when he appears cogsworth will also appear.
* More bosses can now replace the final 3 bosses of the game (previously bosses like luxord could not appear due to his msn requirement)
* LOD Summit now has some enemies randomized, but in the timed fight it is possible some of the enemies won't spawn
* Can now choose where mickey can appear (follow the bosses he normally appears for, stay where he normally is, all bosses, no bosses)
* Added option to make OC cups give you XP and form XP
* Added quality of life option to make it possible to retry data final xemnas without going through data xemnas I again
* Removed the "Selected Boss" and "Selected Enemy" options from the enemy/boss dropdowns, and now if a selected boss/enemy is chosen, it assumes that is what you want
* Removed the ability to choose whether or not to scale bosses because the effect can be confusing/not what is expected. Bosses are now always scaled when possible.
* Misc. small fixes and improvements in a number of spots
* Minute Bombs and Assassins have been removed possible random enemies due to an issue with softlocks resulting from explosions in forced fights. If the randomizer would replace an enemy with Minute Bombs or Assassins, there will be Cannon Guns instead.
