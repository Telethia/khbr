# Ok so I got distracted but I'm moving backwards, I hope I can implement all this by the end of the weekend


# then finish your documentation stuff and "release" it
# then reimplement all the ai mods I have already and test them
# and then I can go over my bug reports from the last run
# then I can do the last couple things in immediate changes
# make tickets for openkh for the 2 things the patcher can't do

# finally with ADP implemented and the evt thing implemented I should be able to go through and add the cutscene removal options the way I want



# for boss rush specifically
# plrp should be blanking out the crit mode stuff so it doesn't crash
# need to start with 6 drive gauge and level 50 stats (00battle changes)
# The second evt thats generated should be the old room program + 1, and go to the current boss location or the final (you can find the end program to modify the jump by checking the spawns for a boss, then outputting the MSN and the program number)
# work with vanilla boss in room
# work with setting a specific boss room 
# num bosses 1 should work
# num bosses 3 should work
# randomize starting stuff vs not should work
# open menu before each fight vs not should work

# Get bonuses should all be blanked out
# Figure out how to get the full 58 items with plrp
# should have TT warp you to the world where the fight will happen first for party member altering
